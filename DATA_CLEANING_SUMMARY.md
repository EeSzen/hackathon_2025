# Data Cleaning Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive automatic data cleaning in the `isValidTrip()` function to permanently remove weird and unusual data from the trip table. No user-facing filters needed - the data is cleaned at the source.

## Problem Identified

The table contained many anomalous entries such as:

- 21 hours duration for only 8km distance (0.38 km/h average - clearly parked)
- 17+ hour "trips" that were actually parking sessions
- Fuel efficiency of 41+ km/L (impossible for trucks)
- Average speeds of 0.09 km/h (essentially stationary)
- Same GPS coordinates for hours (stationary vehicles)
- Unrealistic high speeds and distances

## Solution Implemented

Enhanced the `isValidTrip()` function in `lib/csv.ts` with 12 comprehensive filters:

### Filters Applied (in order):

1. **Zero Distance** - Removes parked vehicles
2. **Minimum Distance** - Removes trips < 0.5 km (not meaningful)
3. **Zero Duration** - Removes impossible trips
4. **GPS Validation** - Removes invalid coordinates or locations outside Malaysia
5. **Negative Fuel** - Removes sensor errors
6. **Long Parking Sessions** - Removes duration > 15 hrs with speed < 2 km/h
7. **Unreasonable Distances** - Removes trips > 1000 km
8. **Stationary Trips** - Removes same location for > 1 hour
9. **Near-Zero Speeds** - Removes avg speed < 1 km/h (idling/parked)
10. **Unrealistic Fuel Efficiency** - Removes < 0.3 km/L or > 15 km/L
11. **Extreme Durations** - Removes trips > 24 hours
12. **High Speeds** - Removes avg speed > 120 km/h

## Examples of Filtered Data

### Before Cleaning:

```
Vehicle: ABA 0048, Distance: 27.2km, Duration: 17.7hrs, Speed: 1.5 km/h ❌
Vehicle: ABA 0048, Distance: 7.3km, Duration: 16.4hrs, Speed: 0.4 km/h ❌
Vehicle: ABA 0048, Distance: 3.6km, Duration: 1.2hrs, Efficiency: 41.6 km/L ❌
Vehicle: ABA 0048, Distance: 1.6km, Duration: 2.0hrs, Speed: 0.77 km/h ❌
Vehicle: ABA 0048, Distance: 0.5km, Duration: 5.4hrs, Speed: 0.09 km/h ❌
```

### After Cleaning:

```
Vehicle: ABA 0048, Distance: 38.0km, Duration: 3.4hrs, Speed: 11.1 km/h ✅
Vehicle: ABA 0048, Distance: 7.3km, Duration: 0.9hrs, Speed: 8.5 km/h ✅
Vehicle: ABA 0048, Distance: 4.7km, Duration: 0.8hrs, Speed: 6.2 km/h ✅
Vehicle: ABA 0048, Distance: 38.7km, Duration: 1.8hrs, Speed: 21.3 km/h ✅
```

## Technical Details

### Modified Files:

1. **`lib/csv.ts`**

   - Enhanced `isValidTrip()` function with 12 comprehensive filters
   - Removed `AdvancedFilterConfig` interface (no longer needed)
   - Simplified `filterTrips()` back to basic day/night and location filters
   - Simplified `computeSuggestedVehicles()` to use cleaned data

2. **`app/page.tsx`**

   - Removed advanced filter state and UI
   - Simplified to use automatic data cleaning
   - Cleaner, simpler codebase

3. **Deleted Files:**
   - `components/filters/AdvancedFilters.tsx` (no longer needed)
   - `FILTER_GUIDE.md` (no longer needed)
   - `FILTER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (no longer needed)

### Performance Impact:

- ✅ No performance degradation - filters run once during data load
- ✅ Cleaner UI - no complex filter controls
- ✅ Better UX - users see only valid, realistic data
- ✅ Automatic - no user configuration required

## Results

The table now shows **only realistic, valid trip data**:

- ✅ All trips have meaningful movement (> 0.5 km)
- ✅ Average speeds indicate real driving (1-120 km/h)
- ✅ Fuel efficiency within truck capabilities (0.3-15 km/L)
- ✅ Durations reasonable for trip distances (< 24 hrs)
- ✅ No parking sessions mistaken as trips
- ✅ No stationary vehicles shown as moving
- ✅ GPS coordinates valid and within Malaysia

## Validation

You can verify the cleaning by:

1. Checking the table - no weird entries like "21 hours for 8km"
2. Looking at fuel efficiency - all values between 0.3-15 km/L
3. Checking speeds - all between 1-120 km/h
4. Verifying durations - none over 24 hours

## Future Enhancements

If needed, these thresholds can be easily adjusted in the `isValidTrip()` function:

- Speed limits (currently 1-120 km/h)
- Fuel efficiency range (currently 0.3-15 km/L)
- Duration limits (currently 24 hours)
- Distance limits (currently 0.5-1000 km)
